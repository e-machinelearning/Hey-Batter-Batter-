    "John Doe is a rich billionaire invester who enjoys investing his money into different businesses and fields. Recently he has taken an interest in baseball and is looking to buy a team. John is also very competetive and enjoys winning. He was able to snatch some pitching statistics from the last 40 years in the Korean league. Knowing that a good pitching staff leads to a good winning team, he has asked us to predict the top 5 teams with the highest win percentage based on their pitching statistics.  \n"

    "So far it's a lot of information but we can already identify that some of these might be more important stats than others. For example ERA which is the number of earned runs a pitcher allows per 9 innings is probably a more important statistic than shutouts. In baseball the more runs you let the other team score the more likely it is your team loses. So having a low average ERA for your pitching staff is going to be a big part of a team's winning percentage. Shutouts on the other hand are pretty rare and is often a pretty low stat. Having a higher number than average is a good thing, but it probably won't be the main determining factor for deciding a team's win percentage. "

    "Initially we see we have some missing values that looks like they correspond to the earlier years of the data (1980s vs 2010s). I also noticed that the spread of the data takes place over 40 years time. Since we are predicting data for 2022, we should know that most professional athletes don't play for 40 years at a time but usually on an average from 5-15 years. We don't have to do anything for now but we most likely will split the data for training/testing based on this knowledge. \n",
