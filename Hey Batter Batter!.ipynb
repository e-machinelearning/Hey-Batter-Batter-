    "John Doe is a rich billionaire invester who enjoys investing his money into different businesses and fields. Recently he has taken an interest in baseball and is looking to buy a team. John is also very competetive and enjoys winning. He was able to snatch some pitching statistics from the last 40 years in the Korean league. Knowing that a good pitching staff leads to a good winning team, he has asked us to predict the top 5 teams with the highest win percentage based on their pitching statistics.  \n"

    "So far it's a lot of information but we can already identify that some of these might be more important stats than others. For example ERA which is the number of earned runs a pitcher allows per 9 innings is probably a more important statistic than shutouts. In baseball the more runs you let the other team score the more likely it is your team loses. So having a low average ERA for your pitching staff is going to be a big part of a team's winning percentage. Shutouts on the other hand are pretty rare and is often a pretty low stat. Having a higher number than average is a good thing, but it probably won't be the main determining factor for deciding a team's win percentage. "
