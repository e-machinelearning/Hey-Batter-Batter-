    "John Doe is a rich billionaire invester who enjoys investing his money into different businesses and fields. Recently he has taken an interest in baseball and is looking to buy a team. John is also very competetive and enjoys winning. He was able to snatch some pitching statistics from the last 40 years in the Korean league. Knowing that a good pitching staff leads to a good winning team, he has asked us to predict the top 5 teams with the highest win percentage based on their pitching statistics.  \n"

    "So far it's a lot of information but we can already identify that some of these might be more important stats than others. For example ERA which is the number of earned runs a pitcher allows per 9 innings is probably a more important statistic than shutouts. In baseball the more runs you let the other team score the more likely it is your team loses. So having a low average ERA for your pitching staff is going to be a big part of a team's winning percentage. Shutouts on the other hand are pretty rare and is often a pretty low stat. Having a higher number than average is a good thing, but it probably won't be the main determining factor for deciding a team's win percentage. "

Since we are predicting data for 2022, we should know that most professional athletes don't play for 40 years at a time but usually on an average from 5-15 years. We don't have to do anything for now but we most likely will split the data for training/testing based on this knowledge. \n",

    "The .describe.T is a good way to look at the entire KBO league stats to see some league averages. However we know that we have quite some data missing from a few of our stats. It's important to note that since these teams are in the league together and facing against each other, our averages mean much more in terms of determining which teams will on average do better. Since they compete in a league against each other that means there is an order of their stats, such as when a team places last place then there is an equally opposite first place and so on so forth. So when team stats are above average that means they are doing better than most of the other league teams. Now this data encompasses all team data from 1980s and teams generally have changed a lot over the years but the league averages should still hold up about the same. Let's check. "

    "However, we know should know that the KBO have made changes over the years to increase the amount of games that are in a season. With this increase in games it makes sense why there might be gaps in games or games_started or why there might be skews in the data. Since the amount of games have increased, the amount of games_finished, innings_pitched, and batters_faced would increase and begin to skew left or the amount of games they started (games_started) would increase explaining a gap between the number ranges. Both games_finished and games_started are also part of our missing data values as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "The complete_games stat also looks skewed right at first but it can be explained that back in the older days of baseball, pitchers used to actually pitch complete games regularly which explains why there is a quite a few numbers in the 15-60 range. However, as time went on this practice stopped due to the prevalence of injuries and trying to preserve player's prime years explaining the massive increase in count for the 0-5 range. Nowadays pitchers don't regularly pitch complete games unless for no-hitters or perfect games which are pretty rare.  \n",

    "Next lets look at some team summary statistics. Right now we see our distributions for our features but they don't distinguish between teams. We're only going to be looking at a few of these features based on our own baseball knowledge to understand which statistics would most likely be important in winning games. Whats important to note is baseball is a sport where you buy runs since runs are what win games. So when looking at pitchers, you want stats that prevent runs. Things such as: \n",
    "\n",
    "1.ERA - (earned run average per 9 innings) \n",
    "\n",
    "2.WHIP - (walks and hits per inning) \n",
    "\n",
    "3.strikeouts_9 - (strikeouts per 9 innings)\n",
    "\n",
    "4.saves - (relief pitchers who end the game on a win)\n",
    "\n",
    "5.innings_pitched - (the amount of innings a team has pitched)\n",
    "\n",
    "The reasons for picking these stats are pretty simple to understand. When playing baseball the more amount of runs you score the higher your chances for winning. So a pitcher's job is to prevent runs and people getting on base (getting on base leads to scoring). A team with a low average ERA, low average WHIP, high average strikeouts_9, high average saves, and high average innings_pitched shows they can prevent runs, prevent people getting on base a lot, and have high durability for lots of games.\n"
